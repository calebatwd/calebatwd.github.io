In an attempt to join the modernization of software developers using personal sites to share their projects and passions, I want to take a few days to try and create a nice, clean facade for all my ongoing projects. Github and Jekyll seem like a great combo for getting this initiative started!

I know it's empty now, but there'll be lots to read in the future!

Thanks!
